# Auth Bot

This is the source code of the **nom's auth** Discord bot as it was termed once and a week after it got termed the new account got pulled back which made me angry enough to just publish the source code and live with it..

Make sure that the redirect uri matches the **index** endpoint in bot.py

You have to change the **host** to your servers ip address and **port** to your designated port.


Enjoy this cute kitten!
